ACS Data Analytics Project: Marriage, Birth Rates &amp; Financial Stability
This project analyzes how financial stability affects marriage and birth rates in the United States, using data from the American Community Survey (ACS).
The goal was to identify trends, disparities, and contributing factors that explain the long-term decline in marriage and birth rates, especially among young adults.

This project was completed for a data analytics assignment connected to the 2024 U.S. Election, focusing on demographic and economic topics impacting voters.
